Document Parsing using Dit Model via FastAPI Server
Introduction
This page outlines the utilization of a FastAPI server empowered by a pre-trained Dit model for parsing various document types. The server employs GPU acceleration for efficient inference and offers an API endpoint to process PDF files, providing JSON responses containing page numbers, bounding boxes, probability scores, and class labels for detected elements like text, headings, tables, figures, etc.

Overview
Technology Stack
FastAPI: A high-performance web framework for building APIs in Python.
Dit Pre-trained Model: Utilized for document parsing and element detection.
GPU Acceleration: Employed for enhanced inference speed and efficiency.
API Endpoint
Endpoint: /parse_document
HTTP Method: POST
Request Payload: PDF file
Response: JSON object containing:
Page number
Bounding boxes
Probability scores
Class labels for detected elements
Usage
Accessing the API
To utilize the document parsing service:

Send a POST request to the /parse_document endpoint.
Include the PDF file in the request payload.
Example Request (cURL)
bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -F "file=@/path/to/your/document.pdf" http://your-fastapi-server-url/parse_document
Example Response (JSON)
json
Copy code
{
  "page_number": 1,
  "bounding_boxes": [
    {
      "x": 100,
      "y": 150,
      "width": 200,
      "height": 50
    },
    // More bounding boxes for detected elements
  ],
  "probability_scores": [
    0.85,
    // More probability scores for corresponding elements
  ],
  "class_labels": [
    "text",
    // More class labels for detected elements
  ]
}
Conclusion
This FastAPI server powered by the Dit pre-trained model enables seamless parsing and detection of various document elements in PDF files. Its GPU-accelerated performance ensures efficient processing, making it a valuable tool for document analysis and information extraction.
